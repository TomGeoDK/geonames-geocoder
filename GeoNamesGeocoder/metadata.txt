qgisMinimumVersion=2.0
description=Geo-coding of places, based on a local copy of the GeoNames database

about=The plugin will use a locale version of some of the name and zip data, provided by Geonames to geo-code features, based on their name or ZIP code. The user will have to have a local version of the Geonames data, since I don't want to put load on the server of the Geonames project. Also does the input file for the search has to provide certain attributes: - country code, and either - location name, or - zip code If both, location name, and zip code are provided, then the plugin will incremental try to find the geo-location. Step one will use the name, while step two will use the zip code for those features that have not been geocoded until then.
